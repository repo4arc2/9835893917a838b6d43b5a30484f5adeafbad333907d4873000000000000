(GROANING)

476
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:55,167
I was brought into HYDRA's Winter Soldier
program to pick up their work

477
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,542
after the five
failed test subjects in Siberia.

478
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,000
When HYDRA fell,
I was recruited by the CIA.

479
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,833
They had blood samples
from an American test subject

480
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:08,333
with semi-stable traces
of serum in his system.

481
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:16,083
After much labor, I was able to isolate
the necessary compounds in his blood.

482
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,333
I was a god.

483
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:25,458
I did what no other scientist
since Erskine was able to do.

484
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:32,542
But mine was going to be different.
No clunky machines or jacked up bodies.

485
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:36,750
Mine was going to be subtle, optimized,

486
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,417
perfect.

487
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,750
How have we never heard about this?

488
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:42,917
Because...

489
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,417
Before I was able to complete my work,
I turned to dust.

490
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,958
Then when I returned,
it was five years later,

491
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:56,083
program had been abandoned,
so I came here.

492
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,708
The Power Broker was more than happy
to fund the recreation of my work.

493
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,792
How many vials did you make?

494
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,375
Twenty.

495
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:11,125
Karli Morgenthau stole those, so...

496
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,708
I can only imagine

497
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,417
what the Power Broker
has planned for that poor girl.

DR. NAGEL: I don't know where she is.

499
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,208
But a couple of days ago,

500
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,958
she called and asked if I
could help someone named Donya Madani.

Yeah. Yeah.

624
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:40,667
Okay.

625
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,792
Thanks. Good work.

626
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,958
They found Madani...

627
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,542
Dead.

628
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,458
She died in Riga,
a city near the Baltic Sea.

629
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,458
I have a place we can go.

630
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:01,125
I, for one, am looking forward
to coming face to face with Karli.

631
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,750
Oeznik, we're changing the course.

632
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,500
Hey, Diego! Lennox! Second van.

633
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:16,167
DIEGO: It's the motherlode.

634
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,750
WOMAN: Enough for a whole camp.

635
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,417
DIEGO: They're just sitting on this stuff.

636
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,125
All right. We good?

637
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,292
Filthy Flag Smashers.

638
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,750
KARLI: You had six months' worth of
supplies, just sat there in that building.

639
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,042
Don't you understand?
We're fighting for our lives.

640
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,042
DOVICH: Karli, aren't you taking your car?
KARLI: No.

641
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,458
Put your seat belt on. Now!

642
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,208
-(EXCLAIMS)
-DOVICH: Shit!

643
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,250
There were still people in there.

644
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,500
This is the only language
these people understand.

645
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,250
ZEMO: I heard what became of Sokovia.

646
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,375
Cannibalized by its neighbors
before the land was cleared of rubble,

647
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,292
erased from the map.

648
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,792
I don't suppose any of you
bothered visiting the memorial?

649
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:48,167
Of course not. Why would you? We are here.

650
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,417
I'm gonna go on a walk.

651
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You good?

652
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,792
Yeah. I'll see you guys in a bit.

653
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,208
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

654
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:10,792
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

655
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,375
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

656
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:42,792
You dropped something.

657
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,167
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

658
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,083
(SPEAKING WAKANDAN)

659
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,833
